# Airbnb-Euskadi
Airbnb Euskadi exploratory analysis 
 
The listing and review datasets used for this project have been uploaded as a cdv file. This data is also available to download via Inside Airbnb (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).
The aim was to answer the following questions:
1) What are the top-ten cities with airbnb accommodation?
2) What is the price distribution in Euskadi?
3) Can we predict the price with a linear regression? Which variables influence the model?

This is the breakdown of the exploratory analysis:

1. Importing libraries
2. Loading datasets
3. Data visualisation
4. Regression analysis
